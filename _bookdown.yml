# By default, bookdown will automatically merge .Rmd files in the root folder
# into your thesis. If you specify a sub directory with rmd_subdir, bookdown
# searches through this folder too. .Rmd files you don't want automatically
# included, should start with an underscore, e.g. _abstract.Rmd (otherwise 
# bookdown would merge the abstract into the body text)

# You can override bookdown's automatic merging of files, and explicitly
# specify files to include with "rmd_files" like this:
#rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "00-introduction.Rmd", "01-how-to-use.Rmd", "07-conclusion.Rmd", "front-and-back-matter/98-appendices.Rmd", "front-and-back-matter/99-references_heading.Rmd"]

# If you want people to be able to suggest and submit changes to the source .Rmd
# files on your github repo, do it like so (https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html)
